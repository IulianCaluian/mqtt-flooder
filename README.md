# mqtt-flooder

mqtt-flooder is a command-line tool for testing MQTT servers by sending a flood of requests. It allows you to specify the rate at which requests are made, the interval between requests, and the timeout for individual requests. With mqtt-flooder, you can stress-test your MQTT server to determine its performance and reliability under heavy load. mqtt-flooder is written in **C#** and is built on top of the .NET framework.
